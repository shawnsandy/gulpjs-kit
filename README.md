A simple boilerplate, starter kit or whatever you wish to call for automating common development task using gulp.js, it allows you to collect and package your files and assets for distribution.

>###Why use a task runner?
>In one word: automation. The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc, the easier your job becomes. After you've configured it, a task runner can do most of that mundane work for you—and your team—with basically zero effort *gruntjs.com*.
